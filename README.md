  <p><strong>Problem detected</strong><br>
    We, the human being are going through a critical threat of a virus Covid 19. People from all over the World either in a fear to have it or in search of a solution through research work and service. Although a Ray of Hope arises as we came to know about the vaccine. It's dangerous for mankind. Along with the Doctors, Nurses and Social workers , Technology has a sole power to fight against any kind of limitations. To have an urge to become a part of the fighter with technology, GRIP has start to step on the challange. Now it's just an informative stage. But if any Team support gets it will start to fight with proper weapon in near future.

  <p><strong>How can technology help?</strong><br>
    Information are all about our existance. Data is just like a Banyan tree. The more it will grow, the more it will serve. But as a tree needs to shape up, information also need to have a shape. So, cleaning, cuting, editing, and DTM, are the integral part to give us a choce to live, to love and to exist. Technology alone can do the same with a proper hand, positive minded people and with a perfect timing.
  </p> 

  <p><strong>The idea: 
    Covid 19 is a real, crucial crisis. But hope it will take a break as vaccine is almost ready to marketized. India, being a developing country with a huge population, awareness is low.Even among people who are certified educated, shows less aware. So, it's a startup try to just give informations statewise. A Diagram, attached, may help to understand for further enhancement to Grip up with the Pandemic.
